Language analysis of the 'Palanca Series', a 16-part anthology with themes of farewell and new beginnings, using NLTK, NetworkX, Seaborn, and other analysis paradigms.

This file contains:
- The Jupyter [notebook](https://github.com/mortrpestl/palanca-nlp-analysis/blob/main/PalancaSeriesAnalysis.ipynb) for all of the code with instructions for importing important tools (e.g. the NLTK downloads)
- The corresponding image outputs of each sub-analysis, including but not limited to:
  - [Frequency analysis](https://github.com/mortrpestl/palanca-nlp-analysis/blob/main/palanca_freqanalysis.png) and [bonus statistics](https://github.com/mortrpestl/palanca-nlp-analysis/blob/main/palanca_stats.png) of all lemmatized texts using NLTK, matplotlib, and Seaborn
  - [Word cloud](https://github.com/mortrpestl/palanca-nlp-analysis/blob/main/palanca_wordcloud.jpg) of common words throughout the text using WordCloud
  - [Spring layout graph](https://github.com/mortrpestl/palanca-nlp-analysis/blob/main/palanca_network.png) and [radial network graph](https://github.com/mortrpestl/palanca-nlp-analysis/blob/main/palanca_radial_network.png) showing appearances of top 50 words in the documents using NetworkX
  - All of the sub-analyses combined in one comprehensive [report](https://github.com/mortrpestl/palanca-nlp-analysis/blob/main/PalancaSeriesAnalysis.png)

## About 'Palanca'

*Palanca* is a 16-piece anthology of letters that I have given out to those who have had left with me great impact, in one way or another, in an important chapter of my life. I realized that it would be fun and constructive to analyze these works to find greater insight into my writing style, as well as the subconscious connections I have written between the letters.

## Software Used:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
